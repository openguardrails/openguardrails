# Open Source License

OpenGuardrails is licensed under a modified version of the Apache License 2.0, with the following additional conditions:

1. OpenGuardrails may be utilized commercially, including as a backend service for other applications or as an application development platform for enterprises. Should the conditions below be met, a commercial license must be obtained from the producer:

a. Multi-tenant service: Unless explicitly authorized by OpenGuardrails in writing, you may not use the OpenGuardrails source code to operate a multi-tenant SaaS environment.
    - Tenant Definition: 
    Within the context of OpenGuardrails, a tenant refers to a logically isolated instance used by an independent user, organization, or client.
    Multi-tenancy includes — but is not limited to — providing separate user environments, dashboards, or API spaces for multiple customers in one hosted system.
    - Examples:
    Using OpenGuardrails within your own company or organization → Allowed.
    Delivering a single customized instance to one enterprise customer → Allowed.
    Operating a hosted SaaS platform where multiple users register and use isolated environments → Requires commercial license.

b. Brand identity and attribution: 
    When using OpenGuardrails’ frontend interface, you may not remove, obscure, or modify the OpenGuardrails LOGO, product name, or copyright information displayed in the product console, web interface, or related applications.
    This restriction does not apply to deployments that use OpenGuardrails purely as a backend or SDK component without its frontend interface.
    - Frontend Definition:
    The frontend refers to all source code and assets within the frontend/ directory of the OpenGuardrails repository, or the corresponding "frontend" image when running via Docker.

2. As a contributor, you should agree that:

a. The producer can adjust the open-source agreement to be more strict or relaxed as deemed necessary.
b. Your contributed code may be used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to its cloud business operations.

Apart from the specific conditions mentioned above, all other rights and restrictions follow the Apache License 2.0. Detailed information about the Apache License 2.0 can be found at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
